 Developed an Instagram-inspired CRUD API using ASP.NET Core,
                                integrating JWT authentication, Azure Blob Storage for image handling,
                                and optimized data retrieval with Entity Framework Core, addressing
                                challenges like scalable data retrieval and ensuring data consistency in
                                high-concurrency scenarios.
